# Omi-Translate

Translation powered by GPT. Whenever a memory is created, it'll be instantly translated to your preferred language.

## Setting Up Translation
1. Open https://uljffb1ro7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev
2. Follow directions by inputting your OpenAI API key
3. Select your preferred target language

## Authentication
1. Get your OpenAI API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Input the key in the setup page (not needed now since using my personal API key)
3. Choose your target language from the dropdown

## Troubleshooting
1. If you're not seeing the translation, it's possible that the API key is incorrect or the target language is not supported.
2. If you continue to experience issues, please contact tonychang430@gmail.com
